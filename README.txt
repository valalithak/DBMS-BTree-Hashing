B Tree implemented in Python which performs FIND, RANGE, COUNT and INSERT queries.

Linear Hashing has been implemented in C++.
Load factor has been taken as 0.85
Bucket size is taken as 128 (considering one input as 8 B in worst case, which makes bucket as 1024 B or 1KB)
We start initially with 2 buckets.

However, the code runs for any size of bucket just by modifying it globally.
